# accents.kt 
Kotlin Multiplatform library for retrieving accent color in a simple way


> Version 1.0 will be released once support for the majority of targets has been completed, the documentation is ready, and the code has been cleaned.

## Supported platforms
- [ ] JVM / Android
- [ ] JVM / Windows
- [ ] JVM / MacOS
- [x] JVM / Linux (GTK)
- [x] JVM / Linux (KDE)
- [x] JVM / Linux (FreeDesktop, dbus)
- [ ] Native / MacOS
- [ ] Native / Linux (FreeDesktop, dbus) `probably won't be supported`

Web targets won't be supported. Check [developer.mozilla/css/accent-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) if you need this feature.

Also, I don't guarantee that I will be able to support Native and/or MacOS targets, so PRs are always welcome.
